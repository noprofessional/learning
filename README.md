# project [learning](https://github.com/noprofessional/learning)
everything learned and everthing learning

# Backgroud
When developing some new project, I find myself learning a lot of things. While at that moment, things seemed clear and unforgetable, truth is without practice, I always found myself relearning everything after a while. So I've decided to take advantage of the unlimited memory of the computer to help me remember and organize information that I consider valuable and memorable. Hopefully, one day my actions will help others when they found themselves struggling to understand something.

# Overview
This project use the directory tree structure to organize informations.

Everything is writen in github markdown which is simple but powerful enough to record and organize info.

There are some advantages:
>1. The path to certain info is clear.
>1. markdown are easy to write.

But there are also some problems
>1. Everything can only have one path, which is not how most info like.<br>
    Generally, a peice of info can belong to many catagories.
    
These problem are mostly beyond my power.

But if I learned something that can solve these problems, I'll definetely post those here.

After all, this is what this project is for -- **LEARNING**
